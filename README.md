Magic Mirror
============

**[(Live demo)](http://4344457357774542.onion/)**

A small, secure, and easy to use encrypted imagehost. 

**Features**
* Can upload images via URL or file
* Uses Tor to mirror images (made to prevent hidden services' IPs from being leaked)
* Can mirror images from i2p websites as well, though you will need i2p installed locally to do so

Note: If you don't have Tor on whatever box you run this on, you'll need to change the proxy settings in upload.php.

**Legal**

I don't care what you do with this file. If you have the source, all of the work I've put in this may as well be yours. You can take my name off of it, change the name of the software, you can do *ANYTHING* you want with it. 'Mi casa es su casa' as the Spanish would say. All I ask is that, if you do use this source elsewhere, that you not use it for malicious purposes and that you not try to view what users upload without their knowledge.

**Credits**

* Me, for writing the code (obviously)
* The good people who developed PHP
* The [phpSecLib](http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/) dev team, for their AES and Rjindael libraries 
* A few various other sources for snippets of CSS

**Installation**

* 1.) Clone this repository
* 2.) Make a directory named "img"
* 3.) Chmod upload.php to be able to write to the img directory
* 4.) Spread the link around!
